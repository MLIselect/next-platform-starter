# The 6:00 AM Silence: Why School Boards Wait

It is the question every parent in the GTA asks while staring at a foot of snow at 5:30 AM: "What are they waiting for?" 

While it feels like a lack of common sense, the gap between a midnight forecast and a 6:00 AM official tweet is actually a high-stakes coordination of bus operators, municipal road supervisors, and provincial mandates. 

Here is the breakdown of why boards like the TDSB, YRDSB, and PDSB wait until the point of no return.

### 1. The 4:30 AM "Ground Truth" Test
While most of the city is asleep, the decision-making process starts at 4:30 AM. Transportation leads (like those at STOPR or STS York Region) don't just look at the radar; they have bus operators actually driving representative routes. 

They are checking for "ground truth"—whether a 60-passenger bus can physically make a turn on a residential crescent or stop safely on a snow-covered hill. If the scouts report that residential side streets are impassable, the recommendation for cancellation is sent to the Director of Education.

### 2. The "93% Walker" Factor (TDSB Specific)
In the Toronto District School Board, approximately 93% of students do not rely on a bus; they walk or take the TTC. The board’s logic is that if they close the school, they are locking out thousands of students who could have safely walked a few blocks. 

This is why Toronto often stays "open" while regions with more rural routes (like Durham or Halton) shut down.

### 3. Safety vs. The Childcare Crisis
School boards are considered a "service of last resort." If a board announces a closure at 10:00 PM and the storm underperforms, they have left 250,000+ parents without childcare for no reason. 

The silence until 6:00 AM is a buffer to ensure that the snow is actually on the ground and the municipal plows are actually failing to keep up.

### 4. The -28°C Threshold
Temperature is often just as important as snow. Most GTA boards have a specific policy for "Extreme Cold." When the wind chill hits -28°C, it triggers an automatic assessment of student safety at bus stops. At these temperatures, frostbite can occur on exposed skin in minutes, making a "Buses Cancelled" call much more likely even if the roads are clear.

### 5. The Point of No Return
The 6:00 AM deadline exists because that is when the first wave of bus drivers starts their pre-trip inspections. Once those buses leave the depot, the decision is locked in.

### Why Monday, Jan 26 is Different
Unlike a typical flurry, tonight’s storm is "overperforming." With Significant Weather Events declared in Oshawa and Hamilton, and institutions like the Toronto Zoo and UTM already closed, the 6:00 AM assessment is likely already a foregone conclusion.

**Current Prediction:** * **Bus Cancellations:** 95%
* **School Closures:** 85%

Stay safe, stay warm, and keep the cars off the street so the plows can do their work.
